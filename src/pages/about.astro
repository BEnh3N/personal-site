        Hello! I'm Bennett, and I'm a student from Las Vegas, Nevada who's been
        interested in computers and technology all my life, as well as music,
        film, photography, camping, and video games.
        <br />
        I am currently attending Oregon State University getting a degree in Electrical
        and Computer Engineering. I work in OSU's <Link

          >Applied Magnetics Laboratory</Link
        > simulating micromagnetic spin waves, and I am also active in OSU's <Link

        <!-- In my free time I like to listen to music, play guitar, watch movies, play
        video games, and do computer science. -->
        I like to spend my free time listening to music (Radiohead fanboy over here),
        practicing guitar, playing video games, reading, watching movies (go see
        Baby Driver), and doing generally outdoorsy things.

      <H>this site</H>
      <p class="font-sans">
        This site is mainly to be used as a personal portfolio of my work and a
        place to
        <Link url="/blog">write about my experiences</Link> with technology, life,
        and maybe even both at the same time.
        <br />
        Big inspiration for this site came from
        <Link url="https://basicappleguy.com">Basic Apple Guy</Link>,
        <Link url="https://jamesbvaughan.com">James Vaughan</Link>, and
        <Link url="https://cobalt.tools">cobalt</Link>. The typing effect on the
        home screen was ripped directly from
        <Link url="https://bun.sh">Bun's homepage</Link>.
        <br />
        One day, I'll write a blog post detailing more about the technology behind
        this site and my arduous journey of creating it.
