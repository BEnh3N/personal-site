Here I am going to introduce this post with a super long line with a link to the [home page](/) and some text with a ~~strikethrough~~, or maybe a

- [x] list
- [ ] of
- [ ] tasks

to get done

## H2 Header

This is some _italic text_

### H3 Header

How about some **bold text**

> Maybe I'll put some stuff inside of a block quote

Or possibly

- List
- Them
- Out

The opportunites are truly endless. I need to fill space here so that I can reach the 65 character limit and test to see how wrapping works...

I can have a short expression like `a=10` or a filepath like `../images/test.jpg`

Or maybe a whole code block like

```
int main() {
  return 0
}
```

I can even make tables (to my genuine surprise)

| Syntax    | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| Header    | Title       |
| Paragraph | Text        |

Finally, the ultimate test: an **_image_**:

![tailwind typography logo](../images/formatting.jpg)
